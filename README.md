# liri-node-app

LIRI is an application just like Apple's SIRI, but instead of a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition interface. It takes in parameters in a command line Node and gives back data to the user.

This project was created as an assignment for the Coding Bootcamp at Case Western Reserve University.
